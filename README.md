2. Classes, properties, and methods follow proper naming conventions and style.
3. Code is readable, organized in a useful way.
4. Code is written by the student, not copied and pasted from solution branches.

## Function

Make sure the app works using the prescribed frameworks. Verify that:

1. Code meets functionality expectations.
2. There are no exceptions or warnings.
3. Code follows best practices taught in class.

## Advanced

1. Set goals for the student to work on outside of class.
2. If working on team or capstone project, review architecture and design.

## Update Dashboard Score

Update scores in your mentor dashboard. Please consider the following in your scores:

1. Attendance in class
2. Communication with you
3. Ability working with frameworks taught prior to this week
4. Ability working with frameworks taught this week

Include any feedback or notes that will guide intervention (help) for the student.
