# Code Review Guidelines

Code Review is the time to catch issues and provide intervention for students who don't understand the concepts from the week. The length of Code Review will vary from student to student, and may take between 20-90 minutes.

## Check

1. All projects are pushed to Github with detailed commit messages.
2. Each project is complete and functioning.
3. There are no exceptions or warnings.
4. Classes, properties, and methods follow proper naming conventions and style.
5. Code is written by the student, not copied and pasted from solution branches.

## Review

Talk through each objective from the week's lessons.

1. Have the student rate themselves (1-5 rating) on each objective.
2. If the student rates themselves 3 or lower, work with them on the objective.
3. If needed, reteach and provide resources or practice on poor objectives.
4. Report the scores for each objective using the Objective Reporting Spreadsheet

## Set Goals

1. Set goals for the student to work on outside of class. Goals should focus on student deficiencies first, then black diamond or advanced work.
2. If working on team or capstone project, review architecture and design.

## Update Dashboard Score

Update scores in your mentor dashboard. Please consider the following in your scores:

1. Attendance in class
2. Communication with you
3. Ability working with frameworks taught prior to this week
4. Ability working with frameworks taught this week

Include any feedback or notes that will guide intervention (help) for the student.
