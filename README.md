# Code Review Checklist

Code Review is the time to catch issues and provide intervention for students who don't understand the concepts from the week. The length of Code Review will vary from student to student, and may take between 20-90 minutes. Follow this outline for a successful code review.

## Review Objectives

1. Work with the student to determine a rating (1-3) on each objective from the week. Find examples of each objective in the projects as evidence of understanding.

  ```
  Rating Scale:
  
  1 - Does not understand
  2 - Understands with assistance (mentor, documentation, sample code)
  3 - Understands independently
  ```

2. If the student rates themselves 2 or lower, work with him or her on the objective. Provide extra practice so they can get to a 3. As needed, reteach and provide resources or practice on poor objectives.

3. Report the scores for each objective using the iOS Student Success Tracker.

## Check Projects

Review the following points with the student:

1. All projects are pushed to Github with detailed commit messages.
2. Each project is complete and functioning.
3. There are no exceptions or warnings.
4. Classes, properties, and methods follow proper naming conventions and style.
5. Code is written by the student, not copied and pasted from solution branches.

## Set Goals

1. Set goals for the student. Focus on student deficiencies first, then black diamond or advanced work.
2. If working on team or capstone projects, review architecture, design, and progress on the project.

## Update Dashboard Score

Update scores in the Dashboard. Please consider the following in your scores:

1. Attendance in class
2. Communication with you
3. Ability working with frameworks taught prior to this week
4. Ability working with frameworks taught this week

Include any feedback or notes that will guide intervention (help) for the student.
